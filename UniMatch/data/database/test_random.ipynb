       "'(45, 21, \"Viterbo State University -> Digital Management of Agriculture and Mountain Areas  The Master’s Degree course “Digital Management of Agriculture and Mountain Areas” (GEDAM) is aimed attraining agronomist or forestry professionals, with particular specific skills in the management of digitaldata, sensors applied to agriculture and forests, precision agriculture techniques, the management ofinformationsystems applied to the management of the mountain territory and agriculture. The graduate will be experienced in the introduction and management of technological innovations in agriculture and inthe mountain areas. The course is part of the LM69 (Agricultural Sciences and Technologies) and LM73 (Forestry and Environmental Sciences and Technologies) interclasses. The interclass MD allows it to differentiate itself from many national training offers as it does not focus only on the strictly agricultural or forestry field, but the vision present in the two MD classes is integrated providing the degree in GEDAM with a distinct character of uniqueness.The Master’s Degree course aims to train technicians with skills in two major areas of intervention in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR): Green Transition and Digital Transformation. Graduates in GEDAM will be able to use digital tools for efficient agricultural production and proper management of the territory with particular reference to the mountain areas.The proposed professional figure will be able to deal with the management of the territory more effectively\\\\nby adopting the most innovative technologies. Moreover, the professional figure, thanks to the strong innovative character and the strong skills in two of the six pillars of the PNRR, makes the graduate in GEDAM particularly in demand in the world of work, thanks also to his skills which are currently difficult to find. The functions that GEDAM graduates can perform will range from research and development in companies in the agricultural, agro-food, livestock and forestry sectors, to collaboration with companies producing technologies applied to agriculture and forests, to territorial planning and control bodies.The setting of the MD and the topics covered lend themselves to the development of an international path: in this regard, a collaboration with the Agricultural University of Tirana (Albania) is in progress, with which a specific agreement will be formalized, for the start of a master’s degree (dual degree) in collaboration with the forest science faculty of the same university.Unlike other degree and master courses on precision agriculture, which are very oriented towards large farms, GEDAM addresses techniques and methodologies that are also applicable to small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) and local realities, such as those characterizing the mountain environment.The course offers teachings such as: information systems, fundamentals of digital engineering applied to agriculture, digital techniques in agriculture, drones and detection systems, innovation in the management of phytosanitary problems, and digital technologies applied to genetics. The course is currently divided into two curricula: the first concerning “Digital Agriculture”, the second concerning the “Digital management of the mountain territory”. In the “Digital Agriculture” curriculum there will be teachings regarding digital cartography of the territory and soils, digital management of water resources and digital applications in animal husbandry, machines and systems for precision agriculture. The curriculum “Management of the mountain territory” will instead have teachings oriented to the digital management of water resources and forest heritage, tourism, environmental monitoring and energy supplies.The knowledge acquired in both curricula will also be developed through practical laboratory and field exercises, interdisciplinary exercises carried out off-site, seminars and internships at companies of the\\\\xa0 sector. Students will have the opportunity to experience abroad, thanks to agreements with international universities already in place for DAFNE’s master’s degree courses.The title of master’s degree acquired through the course of study will allow you to participate in the state exam for qualification to the profession of agronomist and forestry doctor and to participate in PhDschools Master\\'s Degree Technology and Science Italian\")'"
