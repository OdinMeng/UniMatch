Designed with a deep understanding of student needs, this chatbot will\\nprovide personalized recommendations and information tailored to your\\npreferences. Let’s walk you through how you can make the most out of this tool!\\nGetting Started\\nUsing the chatbot is simple and intuitive. Begin by accessing it through the website.\\nIf you’re new, we recommend creating an account to save your preferences and\\nensure the chatbot’s responses grow more accurate and customized over time.\\nExisting users can simply log in and continue their journey.\\nOnce you’re logged in, you’ll find a streamlined interface. The central chat window is\\nwhere you’ll type your questions or commands. If at any point you feel unsure, you\\ncan ask help with the chatbot.\\nPersonalizing the Chatbot\\nThe chatbot thrives on understanding you better. By sharing your preferences, you\\nenable it to tailor its recommendations to your needs. For instance, you can inform\\nthe chatbot about the subjects or industries that excite you. Simply type something\\nlike, “I’m interested in studying artificial intelligence,” and your preference will be\\nnoted. If your priorities shift over time, you can update this information just as\\neasily, saying, “Switch my focus to robotics,” or remove a preference altogether by\\nstating, “Forget about my interest in online courses.”\\nThis dynamic interaction ensures that your recommendations stay relevant as your\\naspirations evolve.\\nMoreover, you can also “weigh” your importances, by saying that some of them are\\nmore important than others. One way to do it is to assign them a number.\\nDon’t worry if you are concerned about your data! At any time, we guarantee that you\\ncan delete them by asking the bot ‘Delete all my preferences’, or just using the\\ninterface to delete the account. Data honesty and protection is our priority, as our\\nfocus is serving the customers.\\nHow Matches Work\\n'),\n",

For\\ninstance, if you’ve come across a PDF outlining a university’s programs, upload it to\\nthe chatbot and say, “Analyze this document”. Then, the chatbot will analyze your\\ndocument and is able to answer your question, while taking into account your\\npreferences.\\nSimilarly, you can share a website link and ask the chatbot to extract relevant details,\\ntailoring to your preferences where possible. This feature is particularly helpful when\\ncomparing multiple options or verifying information.\\nHowever, let it be duly noted that as of now you are only able to upload one\\ndocument or one website at a time; this is due to our technical limitations, as we do\\nnot have sufficient budget to store an infinite amount of information.\\nTalking with the Chatbot\\nWhile the chatbot is focused on helping you with your academic journey, it also offers\\nsome capabilities in conversation. For example, you can ask about our company: you\\ncan inquire about its background, such as, “Who created this chatbot?” or delve into\\nthe values and mission of the company behind it. This transparency ensures you\\nknow exactly what to expect from your interaction.\\nThough not every interaction needs to be task-oriented. If you’re curious about\\ngeneral topics or simply want a friendly chat, the chatbot is happy to engage. Ask fun\\nquestions like, “What’s an interesting fact about AI?” or practical ones like, “Why\\nshould I study abroad?” This conversational capability makes it feel less like a tool\\nand more like a companion.\\nHowever, do not expect perfect answers! Remember that this chatbot is still tailored\\ntoward academic themes.\\n'),\n",
